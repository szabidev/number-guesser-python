# Number Guesser Game

Welcome to the Number Guesser Game! This is a simple, fun, and interactive terminal game built with Python. The essence of the game is to guess a randomly selected number by the computer within a certain range and attempts.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Engage with the game through the terminal, making guesses and receiving instant feedback.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Choose your challenge with 'easy' or 'hard' difficulty levels, affecting the number of attempts you get.
- **Guess Tracking:** Keep track of your guesses - the game informs you if you've already guessed a number and displays your previous guesses.
- **Immediate Feedback:** After each guess, you'll know if you're too high, too low, or if you've hit the jackpot.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Run the game, and you'll be greeted with a welcome banner and a brief description.
2. **Select Difficulty:** Choose between 'easy' and 'hard' difficulty levels. 'Easy' gives you more attempts, while 'hard' offers fewer.
3. **Make Your Guess:** Enter a number between 1 and 100. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Win or Lose:** You win by guessing the number within your allotted attempts. If you run out of attempts, the game reveals the number, and you lose.
